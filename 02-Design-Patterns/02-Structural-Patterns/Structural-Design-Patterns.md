Structural Design Patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures while keeping the system flexible and efficient.
In simple words — these patterns help you figure out how to connect different parts of your system so they work together smoothly without tightly coupling them.

🧩 Definition
    Structural design patterns deal with object composition — how classes and objects can be combined or related to form larger structures while keeping the system flexible and maintainable.

🏗️ Purpose
The main goal of structural patterns is to:
    Simplify the structure of complex systems.
    Promote loose coupling between components.
    Make it easy to extend or replace parts of the system without affecting others.
    Improve code reuse and maintainability.

| **Pattern**   | **Purpose / What It Does**                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Converts one interface into another so that classes with incompatible interfaces can work together.                                           |
| **Bridge**    | Decouples abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.                                                           |
| **Composite** | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Makes clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. |
| **Decorator** | Dynamically adds new responsibilities to an object without altering its structure.                                                            |
| **Facade**    | Provides a unified, simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.                                                               |
| **Flyweight** | Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of objects instead of duplicating them.                                                          |
| **Proxy**     | Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.                                                               |
