/*
    The Factory Pattern is used to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.
    Instead of directly calling new on a class, you delegate the object creation to a factory class or method.

    🧩 Why we use it
        Without factory:
        The client (main function or other code) needs to know which class to instantiate.
        If new classes are added later, you must change the client code — which violates Open-Closed Principle (OCP).

    Imagine you are building a backend that supports multiple payment methods — like Credit Card, PayPal, UPI.

    ✅ Works fine for now.

        Tight coupling — main() knows every class name (CreditCardPayment, UPIPayment...).
        Hard to extend — adding ApplePay means you must modify main().
        Breaks OCP — every time we add new payment type, we edit existing client code.

/*
    ✅ Benefits:
        Client no longer knows about concrete classes.
        Centralized place for object creation.
        Easier to extend — only change factory, not everywhere else.
    ❌ Still has:
        if/else chain inside factory.
        Need to modify factory when new payment types are added → still slightly violates OCP.
